Entity Frame work:

An object relational Mapper(ORM)
Translates our code into SQL commands that update our tables in the database.
When we add entity framewwork, we need to create an important class that derives from the DBContext class, which comes with EF .

This class acts as a bridge between our domain or entity classes and the database

DBcontext class is the primary class we use for interacting with our database.

Example: 
Entity framework, allows us to use linqqueries which are similar as follows.

DBContext.Users.Add(new User{ Id=4, UserName= Lakshmi}) --- > SQliteProvider --> INSERT INTO Users(Id, Name) Values (4, Lakshmi)


Featues:
 Querying
 Change Tracking
 Saving(Insert, update,delete) -- Save changes method
 Concurrency
 Transactions
 Caching 
 Built- in conventions  (EF schema for ID )
 Configurations
 Migrations

 when we want to use a class from different name space , we use using statements
 A DBContext instance represens a session with the database and  can be used to query and save instances of our entities.
 DB context  is a combination of the unit of work and repository pattern

 A DbSet can be used to query and save instances of TEntity. 
 LINQ queries against a DbSet will be translated into queries against the database.
